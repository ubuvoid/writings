# That's Not Oil, That's Blood: An organizing metaphor for circulation in distributed systems.

---

*And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell  
That is, nothin' left that you could sell  
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell  
And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"  
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm  
Or was he just lost in the flood?*

 \- Song by Bruce Springsteen
