# Are There Social Algorithms?
  
### Yes.

*Posted 04/06/2022.*
 
So there's this book called Philosophical Explorations of the Legacy of Alan *\[sic]* Turing, it's an academic anthology. And you've got mathematicians, and philosphers, and experts in digital signal processing for audio, and all of these different disciplines relaying how Turing's work relates to their field and their worldview. It's really interesting.

It covers topics as diverse as the origins of computer music and digital signal processing ("The Early History of Voice Encryption", Craig Baur, and "Turing and the History of Computer Music", Jack Copeland and Jason Long), an elaboration of the branch of contemporary philosophy that most closely follows Turing's own viewpoint ("Turing and Free Will: A New Take on an Old Debate", Diane Proudfoot), and an exploration of the nature of artificial intelligence as Turing conceived it ("Turing on the Integration of Human and Machine Intelligence", Susan G. Sterrett), just to name a few.

And then there's this one article at the end: "Is There A Church-Turing Thesis for Social Algorithms?" I won't say the author's name.

I tried for a long time to come up with a nice way to phrase this, but I just couldn't, so I'm going to be straight with you all:

This article is the wrongest thing I have ever read in my life.

I don't even know where to start. And I have no idea how to write about it without sounding like I'm beating up on the author just to be mean.

That's not what I want to do. I don't intend to be mean. I just think that it makes me sad that this piece is featured alongside some of the most delicate, thought-provoking work I have ever read in my life. This anthology, which again, I recommend wholeheartedly and urge you to read, deserves a more thorough engagement of the theme.

I was really excited to read this piece, too. Because to me the answer is, obviously yes. In my view, to argue otherwise is to deny the fundamental universality of the nature of computing that is at the heart of Turing's work. See Martin Davis's "Universality is Ubiquitous", in the same collection. And again, I can't recommend this collection enough.

### Rephrasing the question.

Let's start with the title: "Is There A Church-Turing Thesis for Social Algoritms?" is a dense sentence to unpack by any standard. In order to understand this question, yet alone answer it, you need to know the following things:

1. What the Church-Turing Thesis is.
2. Who Church and Turing were.
3. Why their thesis is so important.
4. What an algorithm is.
5. A meaningful understanding of what constitutes a "social algorithm", and what makes it different from a from some other (anti-social?) kind of algorithm.
6. An opinion about whether the Church-Turing Thesis, whoever they were and whatever that is, applies differently to different kinds of algorithms, and an opinion about whether "social" versus "non-social" is a meaningful way or even remotely useful way of thinking about this.

What could possibly go wrong?

So imagine, dear reader, my surprise, when the author of this piece professes to believe the following:

1. When discussing the Church-Turing Thesis, it's relevant to bring up things like Game Theory and Epistemic Logic, even though they have nothing to do with the universal nature of information processing, which is at the heart of the Church-Turing Thesis.
2. Game Theory and Epistemic Logic offer no useful framework for reasoning about large groups of people *(this is the only claim in the paper that is actually true).*
3. Therefore, There Is No Church-Turing Thesis For Social Algorithms.

*What?!*

### Rebuttal: "Are There Social Algorithms?"

Are There Social Algorithms? Yes.

Does it follow that the Church-Turing Thesis applies to Social Algorithms? Also Yes.

Done.

Thanks for reading, I needed to get that out of my system. Hopefully, I should  be able to fall asleep now.

### Why does this keep happening?

I wanted to write about this because I don't think it's really about this specific article or this specific author. It's not surprising to me that the author of the wrongest thing I have ever read in my life is a teacher of computer science, because I have heard a lot of teachers of computer science say a lot of astonishingly incorrect things in my life. It's the norm, not the exception.

How did we get here? How did we arrive at an academic culture in the English-language cultural sphere where the philosophers, historians, and mathematicians display a truly gifted, insightful, poetic understanding of one of the world's least understood figures, and in the very same volume, the very discipline that person helped to establish displays a callous lack of regard for the motivations and insights of the person who discovered their entire field?

I'm gonna propose the following: academic computer science is, and always has been, fundamentally compromised by its associations with state and capital powers. It's not feasible for someone who truly believes the things A.M. Turing professed to believe to ever say them out loud in a clear way if they want tenure in a U.S. computer science department. I say this as someone who has spent a lot of time around computer science Ph.D's, and was on the way to becoming one myself before I realized I was utterly miserable in that endeavor.

So I get it.

But Game Theory? Guys. I'm gonna say this once, and I hope have I don't have to say it again:

### Game Theory is for people who don't understand Computer Science.

But ubuvoid, you say, surely you don't mean that! Don't you know John Von Neumann invented Game Theory?

To which I say: Exactly.

John Von Neumann. The guy who built a bomb that was three times more powerful than he meant to. Think aboout that for a second. Is that really the guy you want to be taking computing advice from?

A.M. Turing wouldn't have been caught dead building that device. That's why A.M. Turing was caught dead three months after. Because the U.S. and its allies knew full well, that if any other state power ever wanted to build a hydrogren bomb that actually worked the way it was supposed to, all they would have to do was convince A.M. Turing to come work for them.

That's my read, anyway. Obviously, it's speculation. I suppose it's always possible A.M. Turing might have inhaled that cyanide on purpose, like the cops said.

But you can't write that in a peer-reviewed journal in the field of Computer Science. And that's the entire problem.

In order for the human race to be free, academic computer science as it currently exists must be dismantled. I know it's a hot take, but there you go.

If anyone is interested in giving me an honory Ph.D, my DM's are open.
