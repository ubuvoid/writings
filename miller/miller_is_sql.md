Corrolary: The Ring is XHR.

Earlier this evening I got high and watched this TV show about superintelligent alien computers, and it gave me an idea for an analogy about Turing-Completeness and networking that seems like a very promising entry point to explore a computational theory book for a broad audience.

The show is called "The Expanse", and it concerns a technology that's discovered in an alien artifact orbiting Saturn. The technology is discovered by an Earth corporation, who seek to understand its potential as a weapon. They find it can't be contained, and unimaginable death occurs as a result. Eventually, the technology begins to develop its own intelligence, and builds a structure at the edge of the solar system. A ring.

What's on the other side of the ring, no one knows. Except...
