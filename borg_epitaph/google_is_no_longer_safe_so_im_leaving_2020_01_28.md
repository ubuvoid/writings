# Fwd: \[epitaph] Google is no longer safe, so I'm leaving.

*Editor's node, 2022/04/08:*

*I wrote and sent the following email from my phone during my exit interview upon leaving the Borg Cube on January 28, 2020, roughly six weeks before California issued its shelter-in-place order at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. I felt it was time to share this letter publicly. I have preserved the original text exactly, with one exception of redacted personal information. No names were changed because no one was innocent.*

Hello,

Those of you who work closely with me have undoubtedly noticed my prolonged absence over the past few months. Now that the dust has settled, I am finally able to say my goodbyes.

The past 24 months at Google have been among the most trying of my career. In March of 2018, I came out as a transgender woman. As the year went on, the stress of navigating public space and the workplace as a visible minority, combined with a health crisis precipitated by *\[Editor's note 2022/04/08: None of your damn business.]*, left my unable to perform my job functions effectively. My health issues were not accounted for in my performance review, and I received an NI shortly after being promoted to L5.

This led to a prolonged situation where I, as part of a step-ups plan, was held to timetables and schedules that were not applied to the other engineers on my team. For a great deal of Q2 '19, I was subjected to a hostile work environment, where the L6 engineer I reported to made persistent jokes about naziism, about colleagues struggling with substance abuse, and about sensitive psychological conditions. I began working late into the night to avoid contact with this lead, and as a result my performance suffered.

When I raised these concerns to HR, an investigation corroborated most of my claims, and determined that the lead's behavior did not violate the code of conduct.

I was told I would be removed from my project and placed on an improvement plan. Rather than persue the new project that was assigned to me, I have decided to walk away. I am unwilling to humiliate myself further to keep this job.

These events are co-occurrent with a large shift within Google. Following the walkout in the autumn of 2018, we have seen an unprecedented change in Google's internal policies. Prominent community members and organizers were targeted and fired. The forums that previously existed for demanding accountability from the highest levels of management have been systematically dismantled -- first TGIF disposed of live q&a, then removed off-topic questions all together. All this has been accompanied by a duplicity today was rarely seen before, as high-level executives were observed telling bald-faced lies about hiring personnel whose records in the current administration should disqualify them from any consideration, much less from determining public policy for a company which once bragged that it was unwilling to "be evil".

As I wrote in this quarter's Googlegeist survey, these shifts appear to have come from the very top levels of Alphabet's management. Because of this, I can see no solution other than removing Sundar and the entire board of directors from their positions.

As this is unlikely to happen, I am instead removing myself from Google.

Goodbye, and good luck to my brothers, sisters, and siblings who remain.

\- Ms. Dana Erica Anderson </br>
Senior Software Engineer
